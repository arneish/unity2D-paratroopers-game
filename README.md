# unity3d-paratroopers-game
## Overview
- **Description**: Codebase for implementing the game *[Paratroopers 2018](https://arneish.github.io/)* using the *Unity-3D* gaming engine written in *C#* and *Javascript*. The game is a modern-day version of the classic 1982 MS DOS-based game *Paratrooper*, written by [Greg Kuperberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kuperberg) and published by Orion Software.
- **Developers**: *Paratroopers 2018* co-developed by [Arneish Prateek](https://github.com/arneish) and [Sansiddh Jain](https://github.com/sansiddhjain) as a part of practical coursework requirements in *COP701: Software Systems Lab* (Instructor: Prof. Smruti R. Sarangi) at Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 
- **Some features**: The developers have added modern-day graphics and animations featuring multiple difficulty levels, backgrounds and attacks weapons alongside a wide array of gaming control options. 
- An online demo of *Paratroopers 2018* using *Unity WebGL* can be found [here](https://arneish.github.io/), and a *YouTube* video of the original *Paratrooper* gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5UAgPq2faI).
- *Unity-3D* assets used in the project are not included in the repository.
- Interested developers can easily understand the gaming control logic in the appropriate source files. A prior working knowledge of the *Unity-3D* API for (mostly) *C#* is, however, necessary.
- **Declaration**: Made solely for academic purposes.
